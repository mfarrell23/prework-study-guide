# prework study guide Webpage

## Description

This is a website to use as a study guide while learning to code. We will use this website to help us do well in this bootcamp.


- my motivation for this website is to be able to look back at any notes to remember.
- I built this project so that we had an easy way to recall anything one may have learned during this course.
- This website solves any added stress one may acquire while learning to code.
- I learned that When coding a website each line has it's place and if things don't open and close the computer can not understand what you want.


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
